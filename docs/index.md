## 🎯 Motivation

This repository began as a personal learning journey — a place to experiment, break, fix, and deeply understand the core building blocks of AI and modern software systems.

Instead of just reading blogs or watching tutorials, I wanted to learn by doing — by writing real code, training models from scratch, connecting agents, and seeing firsthand how ideas like RNNs, Transformers, LangChain, and local LLMs actually work in practice.

Each project here represents a small “aha!” moment — and a belief that the best way to grow is to keep building, keep iterating, and stay curious.

If any of these examples help you learn something new (or spark your own experiments), this repo has done its job. 🚀
